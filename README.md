# CS 200: Concepts of Programming with C++

This repo will be  areference guide to the projects completed in my JCCC CS-200 course. Thank you to Professor Singh for hosting the class. Below, a roadmap can be found with links to each seperate project, and a brief discription.

### Roadmap:

- Unit 01: Exploring software
- Unit 02: main() - Intro to the structure of a C++ program
- Unit 03: Variables - Storing data
- Unit 04: cin/cout - Getting input and output from the console
- Unit 05: if/else - Branching if condition is true or false
- Unit 06: struct - Organize related data in a new data type
- Unit 07: ifstream and ofstream - File input and output with the fstream library
- Unit 08: else if - Branching with multiple outcomes
- Unit 09: switch - Branching for certain values
- Unit 10: Function basics - Delegating tasks elseware
- Unit 11: Pointers and memory
- Unit 12: while - Looping while true
- Unit 13: Intermediate functions
- Unit 14: Storing sets of data with Arrays, Dynamic Arrays, and Vectors
- Unit 15: string - Working with text using the string library
- Unit 16: for - Looping with a counter
- Unit 17: Classes - Writing Object Oriented programs
- Unit 18: Inheritance - More Object Oriented Programming
- Unit 19: Recursion - Another way to solve problems
- Unit 20: Searching and sorting - Where's my data?
